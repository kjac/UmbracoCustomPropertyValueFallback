# Custom property value fallback in Umbraco

This repo contains the sample code for my [blog post](https://kjac.dev/posts/customizing-fallback-for-property-values/) about implementing customized property value fallback in Umbraco.

Check the blog post for details ðŸ™‚

To run the sample, open `\src\Site` in a terminal and start the Umbraco site with `dotnet run`.
